A Bayesian Hierarchical Model for Educational Infrastructure Quality using School Effectiveness, and other Spatial/Regional Information

This project is written in both Python and R.

The  School  Effectiveness  Index  (SEI)  is  a  percentage  measure  of  a  school’s  success  in  terms  of  several  factors, including tests, AP enrollment, attendance, dropout, graduation.  There have been previous attempts atexamining the effectiveness of a school using Bayesian and other frameworks.  In this project,  we propose a Bayesian Hierarchical model to predict the probability that the SEI is greater than some nominalα,based on demographic attributes combined with spatial information.  We further extend the model by applying different hyperprior distributions to several of the parametric coefficients of the dependent variables in the data set.
